## 🎓 Key Findings

### What Worked Well

1. **Data Augmentation**: Successfully expanded 9 samples to 120 balanced samples
2. **Feature Extraction**: 168-dimensional MFCC + spectral + chroma features provide excellent discrimination
3. **Model Architecture**: 3-layer MLP (256-128-64) is sufficient for this task
4. **Early Stopping**: Prevented overfitting, stopped at iteration 45/200
5. **Validation Strategy**: 20% holdout achieved reliable accuracy estimation

### Performance Insights

- **Validation score progression**: 35% → 70% → 90% → 100%
  - Reached 70% target by iteration 3
  - Achieved 90% by iteration 9
  - Peaked at 100% by iteration 29

- **Loss reduction**: 1.97 → 0.0012 (99.94% reduction)
  - Smooth convergence without oscillation
  - No signs of overfitting

- **Confidence levels**: Average 92.55% on database recordings
  - 8/9 recordings with >98% confidence
  - 1/9 recording with 44.79% confidence (still correct)

### Class Separability

**Best separated classes**:
- street (100% precision/recall)
- park (100% precision/recall)
- home (100% precision/recall)
- laboratory (100% precision/recall)

**Minor confusion**:
- office ↔ test_lab (1 misclassification)
  - Likely due to similar acoustic characteristics
  - Both indoor environments with HVAC/equipment noise
